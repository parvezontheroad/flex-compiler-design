Flex Project

This project contains a simple **Lex/Flex-based lexer** that reads an input file and identifies different types of tokens such as numbers, decimals, reserved words, identifiers, symbols, and punctuation.

The program demonstrates how lexical analyzers work and can be used as a starter template for compiler design or language processing assignments.

🚀 Features

- Detects **numbers** (integer values)
- Detects **decimal numbers**
- Recognizes several **C reserved words**
- Identifies **identifiers / variable names**
- Prints detected **operators and symbols**
- Handles **punctuation** (parentheses, braces, semicolons)
- Ignores whitespace
- Reads input directly from `lex.txt`

### 🔧 Added by Jakiul — Keyword Counter Feature

This update adds a new feature to the lexer:  
it now tracks and displays the **total number of keywords found** in the input.

#### ✅ Sample Output

```
Total Keywords Found: 5
```

🧩 Customization

You can modify the lexer rules to:
Add new keywords
Support new operators
Recognize strings or comments
Build a full parser using Bison/Yacc
