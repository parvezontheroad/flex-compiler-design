# Lex/Flex Tokenizer Project

This project contains a simple **Lex/Flex-based lexer** that reads an input file and identifies different types of tokens such as numbers, decimals, reserved words, identifiers, symbols, and punctuation.

The program demonstrates how lexical analyzers work and can be used as a starter template for compiler design or language processing assignments.


## 🚀 Features

- Detects **numbers** (integer values)
- Detects **decimal numbers**
- Recognizes several **C reserved words**
- Identifies **identifiers / variable names**
- Prints detected **operators and symbols**
- Handles **punctuation** (parentheses, braces, semicolons)
- Ignores whitespace
- Reads input directly from `input.txt`
